# imageResizer

a small program to resize pictures

- after install nodes
- create a images folder
- set the sizes array in resize.js to the desired widths of the images
- run the resize.js file  ``` node resize.js ```

**carefull all new files are JPG so no transparency that will require further work but it will resize .png files all the same**
